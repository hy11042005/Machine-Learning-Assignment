# Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning and LSTM

This project investigates the problem of sentiment analysis on movie reviews by comparing classical Machine Learning models with a Deep Learning approach based on LSTM.

The task is to classify movie reviews into two categories:
- Positive
- Negative

---

## Project Overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays an important role in analyzing large amounts of textual data. In this project, we study sentiment analysis as a binary text classification problem and compare different approaches in terms of performance and complexity.

The project includes:
- Classical Machine Learning models using TF-IDF features
- A Deep Learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Experimental evaluation and comparison between approaches

## Models Implemented

### Classical Machine Learning
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Deep Learning
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
